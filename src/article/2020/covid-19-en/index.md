#  Covid-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus. While most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will
experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment,
many others need our help.

HOW IT SPREADS

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets
generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets
are too heavy to hang in the air, and over time fall onto floors or surfaces.

People are infected by breathing in the virus if they are within close
proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface
and then eyes, nose or mouth.
