    Breaking the poverty cycle<br />
    of the most disadvantaged

    <p>
      The Freedom from Poverty Foundation is a non-profit foundation working in the community of Jamkhed, located in
      Maharashtra, India, to break the cycle of poverty in families through surgical, educational and community-based
      missions. Each dollar raised is used to improve the quality of life of the population in this region and to help
      them become independent, in the short, medium and long term.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is possible due to a large group of dedicated volunteers from Canada, Europe and around the world
      comprised of doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, public health professionals, accountants, students and
      various other fields of activity. These passionate and dedicated individuals volunteer their services and use
      their skills to help the foundation reach its objective of “breaking the poverty cycle of the most disadvantaged”.
