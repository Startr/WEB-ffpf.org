         <p style="text-align: justify;"> In 2024, five exceptional medical camps illuminated the path of service and care for underserved communities across India.
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtDvWp_1qS0">Dwivedi-Sareen surgical Camp (February 2024)</a> in February provided life-changing surgical interventions, restoring health and hope to countless

         <p style="text-align: justify;">After the Covid-19 outbreak in early 2021, three planned surgical camps were canceled,
             and the allocated funds were used to provide critical resources to Jamkhed, including oxygen, 
             intravenous drugs, masks, and quarantine facilities, as isolation was nearly impossible in rural homes.
