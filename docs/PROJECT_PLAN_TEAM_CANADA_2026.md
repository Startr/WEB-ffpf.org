## Part 5: Guiding Principles

### Strategic Sequencing

1. **Immediate First:** Address public-facing credibility issues (legal footer, contact info, button links) *before* campaign launch
2. **Compliance Foundation:** Legal and operational integrity enables effective marketing without risk

4. **Growth Sequencing:** Broader audience expansion begins with Phase 4 (Impact & Follow-up), when story is proven

### Campaign Integrity

- **Authentic Storytelling:** All photos, videos, and testimonies must be genuine and ethically sourced
- **Patient Consent:** Obtain written consent from patients/families before sharing stories/images
- **Transparency:** Clearly show where funds go; no hidden costs or murky allocations
- **Donor Recognition:** Honor all donors (major and minor) publicly; personalize thank-yous

### Operational Excellence

- **Single Source of Truth:** All campaign dates, goals, and messaging sourced from this plan
- **Role Clarity:** Assign clear owners to each deliverable; establish accountability
- **Timeline Adherence:** Monitor Phase 1 completion (Jan 11–17) as critical gate for Phase 2 launch
